# Hey there! 👋 I'm Mohamed Oubaich

**Senior .NET Developer & AI Specialist** building enterprise solutions that actually work at scale.

Based in Agadir, Morocco 🇲🇦 | Currently leading development at E@sySolutions

## What I'm About

I've spent the last 5+ years turning complex business problems into elegant software solutions. My specialty? Building systems that handle thousands of users without breaking a sweat, and making legacy codebases modern again.

**The highlight reel:**
- Won 2 national hackathons back in 2017 (learned to code under pressure and actually enjoyed it)
- Built ML systems with 95% accuracy that now run in production
- Led my team through multiple legacy-to-modern migrations (yes, including VB.NET nightmares)
- Currently managing a 15-person dev team building ERP systems that serve 10,000+ concurrent users

**What gets me excited:** Taking a messy, outdated system and transforming it into something that makes people's jobs easier. Also, figuring out how to squeeze AI/ML into places where it actually adds value (not just because it's trendy).

## Random Dev Thoughts

```csharp
// My development philosophy in code
public class MyApproach
{
    public bool PreferSimpleSolutions => true;
    public bool TestInProduction => false; // Learned this the hard way
    public string FavoriteDebugMethod => "Console.WriteLine()"; // Don't judge
    
    public async Task<Project> Work()
    {
        while (true)
        {
            await Learn();
            await Build();
            await Improve();
            await RepeatWithCoffee();
        }
    }
}
